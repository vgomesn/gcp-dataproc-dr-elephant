  This heuristic shows GPU utilization and GPU memory utilization for each task type.
  Try to optimize your GPU utilization!
</p>
<p>
  GPU_UTILIZATION shows the percent of time over the past sample period during which one or more kernels was executing
  on the GPU.
</p>
<p>
  GPU_FB_MEMORY_USAGE shows the on-board frame buffer memory usage in percentage. Note, reported total memory is
  affected by ECC (error-correcting code) state. If ECC is enabled the total available memory is decreased by several
  percent, due to the requisite parity bits. The driver may also reserve a small amount of memory for internal use, even
  without active work on the GPU.
</p>
<p>
  GPU_MAIN_MEMORY_USAGE aka BAR1 memory usage shows the percentage of memory used to map the FB (device memory) so that
  it can be directly accessed by CPU.
